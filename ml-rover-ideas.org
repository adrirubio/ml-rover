*** ml rover project ideas
- computer vision projects --> object detection
- black line following
- gesture control 
- voice command navigation
- driving behavior cloning
- dynamic path planning
- imitation learning with style transfer --> aggressive, cautious, smooth
- visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping)
- autonomous navigation with deep reinforcement learning
